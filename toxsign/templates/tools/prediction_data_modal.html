    <p>Prediction models have several performance metrics available, defined during the training:</p>
    <p>Cluster-based models will try to predict whether an experimental condition is in a cluster or not</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b style="color:red">Precision</b> is the measure of <i>How many conditions the model labelled as part of a cluster are actually part of it?</i><br>It is the ratio of True positives/(True positives + False positives)</li>
    <li><b style="color:red">Recall</b> is the measure of <i>Out of all the conditions in a cluster, how many did the model correctly label?</i><br>It is the ratio of True positives/(True positives + False negatives)</li>
    <li><b style="color:red">Specificity</b> is the measure of <i>Out of all the conditions <b>not</b> in a cluster, how many did the model correctly label?</i><br>It is the ratio of True negatives/(True negatives + False positives)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The "best" metrics depends of the user needs</p>

    <p><b style="color:red">Probability</b> is not a metric of the model, but simply the probability that a condition belongs to a cluster</p>
